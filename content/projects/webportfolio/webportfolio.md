**This site**
---

Conceived as a way to better show off all my projects, even those not available on github. Say for example, the [MultiSocial](/content/projects/multisocial/multisocial.html) or the [AgriMonitoring](/content/projects/agrimonitoring/agrimonitoring.html) project. This is a static site meant to be displayed on github's pages or any other static website providers. As such, it's simply a combination of HTML, CSS, and javascript.
