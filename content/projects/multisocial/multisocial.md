# MultiSocial

**A basic Bluesky and Mastodon client.**
---

This project came to be shortly after signing up both on both Bluesky and Mastodon. Posting on both sites one after another with the same content felt tedious, and I wanted a fire and forget way to post my artworks, thus MultiSocial. This project uses Godot for its ease of creating an UI and its interoperability with C#/.net.

**Features**
- Add bluesky and mastodon accounts
- Post text
- Post up to the max 4 images
- Image upload preview
- Alt texts for images

Since MultiSocial was made for my very specific use case, it is a private app. As such, It won't be publicly available.
