The conception of this project was caused by two games. The first was Art of Rally. The second game was Bloodstained, this one was more blatent. Where attacks simply didn't come out. So I decided to make this app with a dual purpose in mind. The first was to see if there was actual skipped inputs or that I was going insane. The second was to create a starter project to familiarize myself with the Godot game engine. 

**Features:**
- Input visualizations
- X-input 
- D-input support
- Input timings
- Chroma support
